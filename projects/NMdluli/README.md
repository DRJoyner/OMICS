# Introduction
Project description: the goal of this project is to use RNAseq data to profile liver stage P. vivax parasites. The resource paper for this data is titled "A single-cell liver atlas of Plasmodium vivax infection".

## Data Set Description
The bioproject number for this data is PRJNA810434. For each sample, I selected uninfected heptocyte samples and P. vivax infected hepatocytes.This way, I can delineate parasite transcriptome information. This will also provide some information on host baseline transcriptome, however, it would be ideal to get a true picture of host transcriptome by comparing uninfected hepatocytes to mock infected hepatocytes. The data will  compare samples from day 1 post infection at early parasite liver stage development (schizont stage) vs day 11 post infection at late parasite liver stage development (comprising a mix of both replicating schizonts and non-replicative hypnozoites).
