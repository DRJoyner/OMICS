## My project
##Introduction
#Project description:
 Malaria parasites have complex life cycle forms providing different developmental strategies uniquely adapted to navigate specific host environments.A single cell RNA-sequencing is able to resolve cell level heterogenity in complex cell populations. The objective of this project is to explore patterns og gene expression in individual parasites accross multiple developmental stages and parasite species.   

##Data sets
The bioproject number of the data on Europian nucleotide archive is PRJEB40487. A single cell RNA sequencing data were taken from ENA archive. This transcriptomic data can demonstrate the gene expression levels of different plasmodium species at various developmental stages(sporozoite, merozoite, trophozoite, schizont, and gametocyte).
