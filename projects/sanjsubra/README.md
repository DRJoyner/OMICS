# Project Ideas 

### 1. Analyzing RNA sequencing data from neuron-glia co-cultures cultivated from mouse hippocampus/cortex.
#### - Cultures are cultivated from WT animals or transgenic animals with a constitutive global knockin mutation affecting GluN2B C-terminus at E1479 or S1480. 
#### - Based on our previous work, the cultures cultivated from transgenic animals are hypothesized to influentially alter NMDAR sublocalization (synaptic vs extrasynaptic).
#### - Based on the specific mutation, we hypothesize that we will obserupregulation of synaptically-linked pathways with the E1479Q mutation, and extrasynaptically-linked pathwaus with the S1480E mutation.

### 2. Analyzing whole exome sequencing data for GRIN2B mutations affecting the C-terminus of the GluN2B protein in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (for lit review).
