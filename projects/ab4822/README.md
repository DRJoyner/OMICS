##INTRODUCTION

Epigenetic modifications play a critical role in regulating gene expression and cellular function, and their disruption can contribute to various disease states. In the context of neuroHIV, which involves HIV infection of the central nervous system (CNS), these modifications may profoundly impact neural cell behavior and contribute to the pathology of the disease.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a powerful technique that allows for the comprehensive analysis of epigenetic modifications across the genome. By targeting specific histone modifications and DNA-binding proteins, ChIP-seq provides insights into the regulatory landscape of the genome and how it may be altered in disease conditions.

This project aims to explore the epigenetic modulations associated with neuroHIV by analyzing ChIP-seq data from PubMed. The objective is to identify and characterize changes in histone modifications, transcription factor binding, and other epigenetic marks in neural tissues affected by HIV. By comparing these findings with known epigenetic profiles in healthy and disease states, this project seeks to uncover key mechanisms through which HIV influences the epigenome of neural cells.

Understanding these epigenetic alterations is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate the impact of HIV on the CNS and improve outcomes for individuals living with neuroHIV.
