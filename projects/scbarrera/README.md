#Project: Knockout CRISPR Screen Determining Important Genes for HIV-1 Latency Reversal

### Description: This project will utilize data from a CRISPR knockout screen publication. Investigating host genes required for the reversal of HIV-1 latency.

### Screen Data: J-Lats (latently infected T cells) were tranduced with a lentiviral vector containing library of sgRNAs targeting genes of interest & flanked by a Î¨-packaging signal. This signal allows sgRNAS to be packaged into budding virions. Cells were treated with activating doses of LRAs (latency reactivating agents). Sequence both the supernatant containing sgRNAs vs. gDNA knockout pool. 

### Expected Results: Genes required for reactivation from latency will be depleted in the viral supernatant and not in the genomic knockout pool. The study determined CCNT1 as important. While HIV-1 Tat viral protein binding sites are conserved in CCNT1 and CCNT2, CCNT1-Tat complex can bind with the viral TAR RNA in order to recruit P-TEFb to the LTR.

##Goals: 
1. Proper mapping of reads
2. Comparing the genes that I determine as important for JIV-1 latency reversal are the same as the paper.
