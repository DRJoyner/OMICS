# Introduction 
I will be working on a project that is analyzing HIV provirus data.
The data for this project is located: /home/jupyter-jb4622/share/jordan/OMICS/data. 
The files contain HIV provirus sequencing data from two individuals (T78276, T96768). Tissue samples include right middle fontal gyrus (MFG), spleen (SPL), and cerebrum (CER).
