IF, you are in normal mode, and you want to go to insert mode you can just press "i". However there are other ways to go from normal to insert > more specifically. When in normal mode, instead of just using "i" for insert, you can also use the following commands:

i: insert/start typing where the curser currrently is
I: insert at the start of the line 
A: insert or "append" at the end of the line 
O: open a new line above
o: open a new line below
