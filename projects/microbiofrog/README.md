## Description

I am analyzing *P. vivax* samples from Duffy negative and positive people from Botswana to round out analysis I am already conducting for people from Sudan. I am interested in comparing SNPs between Duffy negative and positive individuals and finding regions that may be unique in Duffy negative people that may lead to a reason for the parasite infecting the Duffy negative people. I will be looking at 43 potential erythrocyte binding genes, the LDH gene, as well as other noncoding areas that may affect expression of the 43 or other genes. Typically, parasites infecting Duffy negative individuals are less polymorphic than those in Duffy positive individuals, potentially due to a smaller pool and lower parasitemia.
