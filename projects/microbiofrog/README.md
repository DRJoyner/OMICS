# My project

## Description

I will be analyzing WGS and transcriptomics data for Duffy Negative vs Duffy Positive individuals to observe differences in genetic variation and observe any patterns in comparison to data from other countries. I want to also look at transcriptomics data alongside the WGS to see if the variations found in the DNA are being transcribed to determine if there is a functional effect of the SNPs.
