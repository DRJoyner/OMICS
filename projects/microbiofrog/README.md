I will be analyzing WGS and transcriptomics data for Duffy Negative vs Duffy Positive individuals to observe differences in genetic variation in the genome as well as in the mitochondria and apicoplast. I want to look at transcriptomics data alongside the WGS to see if the variations found in the DNA are eing transcribed to determine if there is a functional effect of the SNPs.
